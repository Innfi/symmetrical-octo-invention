## Layer

>[!tip]
>- a data processing module, receives one or more tensors as input, emits one or more tensors as output
>- has weight as status (except flatten, pooling, dropout layer)

[[Keras-Dense]]
[[Keras-Conv2D]]
[[Keras-MaxPooling2D]]
[[Keras-Flatten]]

## Activation Function
- [[ReLU]]
- [[Sigmoid]]
### Requirements for Model training (before model.compile())
- [[Optimizer]]
- [[Loss Function]]
- [[Keras-Metrics]]
